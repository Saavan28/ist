<h2>➙ Subjects That I Study:</h2>
</body>
</html>
		<ol>
			<p>I currently study at Hurlstone Agricultural High School at Year 9. Agriculture is a mandatory subject at my school as it is agricultural and has an extremely large farm. Subjects 2 - 7 all are compulsory. I chose Food Technology as a minor (100h) subject and IST (Internet Software Technology) as a major (200h) subject. My favourite subject is Food Technology because I enjoy making different meals every lesson. On the other hand, my least favourite subject is Mathematics because I find most concepts such as Algebra to be extremely boring and difficult. The image on the full right is a Brown Swiss Cattle on Hurlstone's school farm. The image beside it is a meal that I made for a Food Technology assessment.</p>

		<img src="file:///Users/saavan/Downloads/IMG_4139.jpg" width="350" height="300">
	<p>There are several hobbies that I enjoy doing in my free time. I enjoy playing video games on my laptop such as ROBLOX and Minecraft. I also like watching American seasons of Survivor on Tenplay: All Access. When the weather is right, I ride my bike around the park which is right in front of my house. I enjoy doing chores for my family such as washing the dishes and hanging the clothes. Finally, I enjoy communicating with my friends on Instagram or Discord. The image on the full right is a photo of me on my bike in front of the sunset at the nearby park.</p>

	<li>Socialising online</li>
	<p>I have grown an interest in multiple things throughout my life. Firstly, the concept of strategic gaming (such as chess) is something that I'd like to get myself more involved in. Traveleing the world with my family is something which I'd really like to do when I'm older. Photography is another thing which engages me because I've always wanted to know how to express emotion visually. I also would like to learn more about and experience filmmaking.</p>
