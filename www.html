<p>The World Wide Web (WWW) allows users to locate and share information through the Internet web pages by providing a variety of documents, all of which are linked through electronic connections. These connections are typically called hyperlinks, a feature which allows direct jumps between related sections of text and associated graphic material.
A web server is a hardware and software system which uses protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web. All computers that host websites must have web server software. A web server’s main role is to display content of websites by storing, processing and delivering web pages to users.
To access web pages, users must use a web browser, otherwise known as a browser. Web browsers are applications used to access the World Wide Web. They provide the software which allows users to click hyperlink resources with the use of a mouse. Common web browsers include Google Chrome (image), Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, etc. You can locate particular websites with the use of your browser by either conducting a search through the search engine bar or by typing the website’s Uniform Resource Locator (URL). </p>

<h2>➙ Internet VS World Wide Web (WWW):</h2>
<ol>

<p> The internet is a global network of networks, whereas the World Wide Web (WWW) is a large collection of information that runs on the internet and can’t operate without it. The internet existed far before the WWW was created, which was in 1989. Web applications use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) protocol, whereas the internet applications use either the Transmission Control Protocol (TSP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) protocol.
Think of it like the roads - The internet is the roads that connect towns and cities together. The world wide web contains the things you see on the roads like houses and shops. The vehicles represent the data that is moving around. </p>

<h2>➙ Intranets:</h2>
<ol>
	<p>An intranet is a private network website that only a few selected users can have access to. Intranets work similarly to normal websites from the internet as web pages can be accessed normally from a web browser. The main difference between intranets and the internet is that intranets are closed networks, whereas the internet is easily accessible to everyone. Intranets are most commonly used as a company website for employees to know more about what is happening in the company without letting others see. They’ve been used for decades by enterprises to distribute communications exclusively to their workforce.</p>

<h2>➙ Internet Protocols:</h2>
<ol>
	<img src="file:///Users/saavan/Downloads/1200px-HTTP_logo.svg.png" height="280" width="500">
	<p>An Internet Protocol (IP) communicates a set of rules that dictate how data should be delivered over the internet so that they can arrive at the correct destination. Data travelling the internet is divided into smaller pieces called packets. Each computer on the Internet has at least one IP address that uniquely identifies it from all others. IP information is attached to each packet, and as packets are directed to the IP address attached to them, data arrives where it is needed. Below are some examples of Internet Protocols.
<li> Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) - The protocol used to transmit hypermedia documents, such as HTML. </li>
<li> Transmission Control Protocol (TCP / IP) - The protocol used to allow computers to communicate on a network. </li>
<li> File Transfer Protocol (FTP) - The protocol used to transfer files between computers. </li>
